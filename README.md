## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Bootstrap customized
- Sass
- Parcel
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

With this project I tryed to customized Bootstrap Library, including the framework inside my Parcel bundler and then applying custom styles.
I learned also the basics of form validation, which in this project is done with the help of the [Validator.js library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator).
To built the HTML & CSS Markup, I tried to follow the steps detailed in the article [A step by step guide to turn design into code](https://css-tricks.com/a-step-by-step-process-for-turning-designs-into-code/)

### Continued development

This project Is almost competed with all the requirement of the challenges but It's far to be perfect. So maybe next month I will try to reopen again the code and see if the code is readable and understandable again.

I hope you will find my resources helpful for your projects too. ;)
